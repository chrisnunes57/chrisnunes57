### Hi, I'm Chris 👋

I'm a coder who really likes doing crossword puzzles and climbing rocks. I'm currently a software engineer at Microsoft, working with digital signatures, certificates, and cryptography. In my free time, I like to create websites, and I'm always trying to learn more about cyber security and penetration testing.

  - 💻 I'm working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft!
  - 🤓 I'm currently learning about Cryptography and Pentesting
  - 💬 Ask me about web development, rock climbing, or sports (that's really all I do)
  - 📪 Contact me at [chrisnunes57@gmail.com](mailto:chrisnunes57@gmail.com)
  - 🥵 Check out my blog at [chrisnun.es](https://chrisnun.es) (I promise I'll post something not-code-related eventually)
  - 😁 Pronouns: he/him
  - 🤯 Fun fact: I can do a New York Times Mini Crossworld puzzle in *6 seconds*
